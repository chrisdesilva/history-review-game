  "description": "History Heroes is a React app that allows users to enter questions and answers in a Jeopardy-style format. Designed for teachers to use as a review game, the user can enter 5 categories, each with a beginner, intermediate, and advanced level question. As a History teacher, I named the app History Heroes, but I'm certainly open to any clever cross-curricular name changes.",
